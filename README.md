# Multimodal-Object-Detection-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
This is a project about using multi-modal which merges the RGB and IR to do object detection in car cabin.

Cause the project is running on GPU, the content will be updated on the website later.

The first model trained by yolov5l is updated and the result is obtained by setting 300 epoch and 16 batch-size, the result is shown in exp2.

The second model trained by yolov5l is updated and the result is obtained by setting 300 epoch and 4 batch-size, the result is shown in exp.
