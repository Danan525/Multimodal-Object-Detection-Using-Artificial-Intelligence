# Multimodal-Object-Detection-Using-Artificial-Intelligence
This is a project about using multi-modal to do object detection in car cabin.

Cause the project is running on GPU, the content will be updated on the website later.

The first model trained by yolov5l is updated and the result is obtained by setting 300 epoch and 16 batch-size.
